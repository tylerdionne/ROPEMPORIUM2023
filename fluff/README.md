# Challenge 6: fluff
Steps:
- Find offset to RSP by sending a large cyclic to the program then using GDB to find the value stored in RSP. Once find the value stored in RSP, take the first four bytes which in this case was "kaaa", then use the command cyclic -l “kaaa” to find the offset. In this case it was 40.
